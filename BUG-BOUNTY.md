## Scope of this bounty program

This bounty is open for an unlimited time. Previous limited-time bounty programs were:

* Round 1 — **2018-03-01 at 00:01 GMT** to **2018-03-04 at 23:59 GMT**
* Round 2 — **2018-07-02 at 00:01 GMT** to **2018-07-07 at 23:59 GMT**

Help us find any problems with this contract and with ERC-721 in general. This bounty program's function scope includes:

- Overflow or break parts of the program
- Steal ownership of a square
- Take over an admin account
- Give a square to somebody else and double spend it or revert it back to your control
- Any undocumented and unintuitive behavior

## Rules and rewards

- Issues that have already been published here or are already disclosed to the Su Squares team are not eligible for rewards
- Social engineering, XKCD#538 attacks, bringing down Mainnet/Infura are not in scope and will NOT be paid a reward
- Only the official mainnet contract is in scope, our website is not in scope
- GitHub issues is the only way to report issues and request rewards
- The Su Squares team has complete and final judgement on acceptability of issue reports

Following is a risk threat model that judges the impact of an issue based on its likelihood and impact.

|                 | NOT LIKELY      | :left_right_arrow: | VERY LIKELY          |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **HIGH IMPACT** | Medium severity | High severity      | **Highest severity** |
| :arrow_up_down: | Low severity    | Medium severity    | High severity        |
| **LOW IMPACT**  | *Notable*       | Low severity       | Medium severity      |

Rewards:

- **High severity / highest severity** — you will received two Su Squares on the deployed website (worth $1000 USD)
- **Low / medium / high / highest** — all of these reports will receive an honorable mention, which is also visible from [the Su Squares website](https://tenthousandsu.com)
- Additional rewards may be announced by sponsors? See [sponsors section](#sponsors) above.

Examples of impact:

- High: Steal a square from someone else, impersonate an admin
- Medium: Cause personalization to fail so that the wrong data goes on the blockchain
- Low: Cause a transaction counterparty that carefully reads the contract documentation to make a mistake on some edge case type of transaction

How to win:

- Be descriptive and detailed when describing your issue
- Fix it — recommend a way to solve the problem
- Include a Truffle or detailed test case that we can reproduce

Rules for bounty sponsor:

- We will respond quickly to your questions (within 2 business days)
- We will adjudicate all prizes quickly (within 5 business days)
- Bounty sponsors are not eligible

## More questions

- Will things change during the bounty program?
  - Yes, we are seeking sponsors and will add additional prizes here if that happens.
  - Yes, we will update the code and redeploy the contract. So, click STAR and WATCH above on this repo for updates.
- Taxes?
  - If sponsors give us so much money that you will need to fill out a tax form, then we will ask you to fill out a tax form. This whole program is subject to the laws of Pennsylvania.
- I read to the bottom of the file.
  - That's not even a question. Good, you're the type of person we're seeking. Here's a hint, you can see the [CryptoKitties bounty program](https://github.com/axiomzen/cryptokitties-bounty) and everything that happened there. We stole lots of ideas from them, thank you.
